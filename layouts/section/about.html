            Grosser_Panda.JPG is the name of a picture of a panda in the Hong Kong zoo. More than just that, it's the
            main picture of the Wikipedia panda page. I choose this name because, first I love pandas, by multiplying
            this picture on my friends' laptops I ended by knowing its URL by heart
            (https://wikimedia.upoad.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Grosser_Panda.JPG).
